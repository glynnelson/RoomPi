# RoomPi
 Paspberry Pi for monitoring room and incubator temperatures
 
 This document describes how to build a Raspberry Pi with two temperature probes that report to ThingSpeak, a website that will plot the data for you using inbuilt or matlab functions, and also send an email if the temperature goes above a set point.  We use these to monitor room temperature for microscopes where the stability of the temperature affects the performance of the microscope.  We also use the second probe to monitor the microscope incubator for live cell imaging, to ensure temperatures remain stable throughout experiments. 
 
 The python script will work with the modifications added as detailed in the pdf.
